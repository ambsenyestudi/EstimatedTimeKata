# Estimated Time Kata
Estimated time Kata originated from one of my team's members pointing out that time descriptions were inaccurate. Most of the time when working with strings representing time, we get pluralization errors.

For instance:
* 1 hours and 1 minutes
* 2 hours and 0 minutes 
* 0 hours and 45 minutes 


## Task

Develop a feature that allows correct time displaying and can be toggled off.

## Acceptance

From the following description develop an [acceptance test](Docs/AcceptanceTesting.md) before any coding.

### Trip description

Walk on the beach at sunset at beautful Platja d'es Capellans, Can Picafort, up to the hut bar for some cocktails.
Estimated duration 1 hours and 1 minutes.
